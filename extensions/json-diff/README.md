<h1 align="center">JSON Diff</h1>

<p align="center">
Paste two JSON snippets and instantly see what changed — right from Raycast.
</p>

## Getting Started

1. Open Raycast and search for **Compare JSON**
2. Paste your original JSON in the first field
3. Paste the modified JSON in the second field
4. Compare to see the diff

The diff view highlights added and removed lines with color-coded syntax, collapses unchanged regions for readability, and shows a summary of total changes.

## Features

- **Real-time validation** — Syntax errors appear inline as you type, so you catch issues before comparing
- **Compact diff view** — Only changed lines are shown with surrounding context, keeping large diffs readable
- **Format JSON** — Auto-format both inputs with `Cmd+Shift+F`
- **Swap inputs** — Reverse the comparison direction with `Cmd+Shift+S`
- **Paste from clipboard** — Paste directly into either field with `Cmd+Shift+1` or `Cmd+Shift+2`
- **Copy results** — Copy the full diff, compact diff, or either formatted JSON from the result view

## How It Works

JSON Diff uses the [Myers diff algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff#Myers_algorithm) to compute the minimal edit distance between two pretty-printed JSON documents. The result is displayed as a compact, syntax-highlighted diff with surrounding context — similar to `git diff` output.

All processing happens locally.
